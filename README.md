**Beta version of a 100% native Salesforce solution to visually track, analyze and review deployment activity over time**, complementing Salesforce’s default DeployRequest retention with extended historical tracking.  
It also allows you to easily review **deployed components**, quickly identify **failed deployments**, access **deployment status** directly from deployment result records, and gain deeper visibility into your deployment process.

## Installation 📥

## Overview ✨

**Lug Deploy Tracker** is a Salesforce solution designed to track and analyze deployment activity by retrieving `DeployRequest` data via the Tooling API.  

It provides advanced scheduling, synchronization, and reporting features to help administrators and developers gain full visibility into past deployment activity.

This app is **heavily inspired** (in spirit and in look & feel) by the great [Nebula Logger](https://github.com/jongpie/NebulaLogger) — though much simpler and focused on deployment tracking.  
Some structural and UI ideas are also borrowed from [chat-gpt-sfdc](https://github.com/ArnasBaronas/chat-gpt-sfdc), a very well-structured LWC Salesforce project.

### Features ⚙️

- 🔍 Synchronize `DeployRequest` records using the Tooling API.
- 📊 Store detailed deployment results in custom objects:
  - `DeployResult__c`
  - `DeployResultComponent__c`
  - `DeployResultTest__c`
- ⏰ Configure automatic synchronization frequency (daily, hourly).
- 🎛️ View and manage settings via **Lightning Web Components** (LWC):
  - Schedule settings
  - Advanced options
  - Manual synchronization
- 🚥 Track progress of batch synchronization via Platform Events and progress bar.

## Dashboard Example 📊

Here's a visual example of a full Deployment Dashboard built using the results provided by this app, with filters for **time range** and **deployment status**.

## Installation Steps 🛠️

1. **Before using the app, you must create a Named Credential** for Tooling API access.

👉 [How to create a Named Credential](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=platform.perm_uapa_create_a_named_credential.htm&type=5)

2. **After installing Lug Deploy Tracker:**

- Open the app via **App Launcher**.
- Go to the **Advanced Options** tab.

![Advanced Options](media/images/deploy_advance.png)

- Select the Named Credential you just created.
- Configure advanced options:
    - Retrieve Components
    - Retrieve Tests
    - Retrieve Intermediate States
- Assign the **DeployAdminAccess** permission set to any users who should have access to the Lug Deploy Tracker app.

## Usage 🖥️

### Manual Synchronization

You can trigger sync manually by using the **Synchronization Settings** tab.

- If the **Start Date** field is left empty, the app will automatically retrieve data from the last 30 days.
- If the **End Date** field is left empty, the app will retrieve data up to today.

![Synchronization Settings](media/images/deploy_sync.png)

### Scheduled Synchronization

You can also configure periodic automatic sync:

- If you schedule synchronization to start at 16:00 with a frequency of 2 hours, the app will automatically retrieve DeployRequests from the last 2 hours starting from 16:00, and will repeat this process every 2 hours.
- The next scheduled execution time is always displayed in the form.

## Architecture Overview 🏗️

**This Salesforce Diagrams template shows how Lug Deploy Tracker uses asynchronous batch processing with the Tooling API to synchronize and track DeployRequest data.** Progress events (DeployProgress__e) are published after commit and consumed in real time by a Lightning Web Component to display batch progress during manual synchronization.

### Frontend (LWC)

### User Interface Layer

- `deploySettingsApp` — Main container app
- `deployHeader` — Application header
- `deploySyncSettings` — Manual synchronization UI
- `deployScheduleSettings` — Schedule settings (start date, unit, frequency)
- `deployAdvancedSettings` — Advanced options (batch size, named credential, intermediate states)
- `deployErrorHandler` — Reusable error handling component
- `deployToastService` — Reusable toast notification service

### Backend (Apex)

#### Service Layer

- `DeployService` — Entry point for synchronization logic (called by LWC)
- `DeployScheduleService` — Handles schedule logic (`System.schedule`)
- `DeployRequestBatch` — Batch Apex that performs DeployRequest synchronization (Tooling API)
- `DeployServiceTest` and related test classes — Test coverage

#### Integration Layer

- `DeployToolingClient` — Integration with Salesforce Tooling API (fetch DeployRequest and DeployResult data)
- `DeployToolingClientInterface` — Interface for Tooling Client
- `DeployToolingApiMock` — Mock for Tooling API tests

#### Data Access Layer

- `DeploySetupRepository` — Manages configuration data and settings persistence (Custom Setting)
- `DeployValidator` — Validates configuration and access
- `DeployAccessValidator` — Validates user access permissions
- `DeployCoreUtils` — Core utility functions for configuration management, cron scheduling, and integration with scheduling services  
- `DeployUtils` — Utility functions (MD5 hashing, cron generation, date utils, etc.)
- `DeployConstants` — Centralized constants (configuration and error messages)

#### Data Mapping Layer

- `DeployApiWrapper` — Deserializes Tooling API responses into wrapper objects (DeployRequest, Result, Details, Components, Tests)
- `DeployResultMapper` — Maps `DeployResult__c` from Tooling API data
- `DeployResultComponentMapper` — Maps `DeployResultComponent__c` from Tooling API data
- `DeployResultTestMapper` — Maps `DeployResultTest__c` from Tooling API data

### Platform Events

- **Progress Events** — The batch process publishes progress updates through the `DeployProgress__e` Platform Event, which drives the live progress bar in the LWC during synchronization.

### Data Model

#### Custom Objects

- `DeployResult__c` — Deployment master record
- `DeployResultComponent__c` — Deployed components (per DeployResult)
- `DeployResultTest__c` — Test results (per DeployResult)

#### Configuration

- `DeploySetup__c` — Hierarchical Custom Setting (used for operational state during execution and by the LWC)

## Next Steps 🚀

Planned features for upcoming versions:

- ⚙️ **Handling Partial Results in Batch Apex** to improve resilience on very large datasets.
- 🗑️ **Purge management**: implement automatic cleanup of old `DeployResult__c` records after configurable retention period.
- 📈 **Lines covered / FlowCoverage**: expose visual coverage metrics for both code and flows.
- 🗂️ **Component and Test Class Summary Views**:
  - Provide a clear **list of component names** that have errors or warnings (without duplicating full line-by-line error already detailed).
  - Provide a clear **list of test classes** that have errors or coverage warnings (without showing individual test methods, which are already detailed).
